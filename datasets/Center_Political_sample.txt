Nearly one year has passed since Hamas’s attack on Israel triggered a retaliatory military campaign from Israel that has transformed into a two-front conflict in Gaza and Lebanon, creating a range of shifting opinions from Americans concerned with the bloodshed and a potentially broader war in the Middle East.

Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel killed about 1,200 people and was met with retaliatory attacks from Israel that have killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the region’s Hamas-run health ministry.
<E>
<S>
The U.S. has provided billions of dollars in aid to Israel since last year and has pushed for a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, though only one short-lived ceasefire materialized last November, lasting for just six days.

The U.S., which has about 40,000 troops stationed in the Middle East, will send a few thousand more troops to the region as Israel targets Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, where more than 2,000 people have been killed.

Do Americans Support Israel’s War Against Hamas?
<E>
<S>
About 3 in 10 (31%) Americans believe Israel’s military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll, which shows a plurality of Americans, 36% to be exact, are unsure about Israel’s handling of its war with Hamas. Meanwhile, 20% of Americans believe Israel is doing enough while 12% say Israel should be doing more—but both of those numbers have declined in the past 10 months, from 25% and 16%, respectively.
Do Americans Want The U.s. To Play A Role In Ending The War?
<E>
<S>
The Pew Research Center poll also found more Americans in September said the U.S. should play a role in resolving the war diplomatically (61%) than they did in February (55%). And Republicans in September remained more likely than Democrats (25% vs. 13%) to say the U.S. should not be involved in the diplomatic resolution of the war, according to the Pew Research Center, a drop from the 32% of Republicans and 21% of Democrats who said in February there should be no U.S. involvement in the war’s resolution.
Who Do Americans Sympathize More With, Israelis Or Palestinians?
<E>
<S>
A new survey from the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 25% sympathize more with Israelis, and 15% sympathize more with Palestinians. Most—31%—claimed to have equal sympathy for both sides, and another 26% report having no sympathy for either. These numbers also have not changed much since before the attack on Israel last year.
What Do Americans Think About The Establishment Of An Independent Palestinian State?
<E>
<S>
The Associated Press-NORC survey marked an increase in the number of Americans who support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, up to about 29% now compared to 22% before the Oct. 7 attacks, in August 2023. Around half of the Americans surveyed said they neither favor or oppose an independent state (a drop from 58% in August 2023), while 17% were opposed, about what it was (15%) in 2023.

The Northern Lights can potentially be seen from several northern U.S. states Saturday night, according to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration update, as space weather forecasters predict an increase in geomagnetic activity capable of triggering a strong aurora borealis.
<E>
<S>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has forecast a KP index of seven for Saturday night, meaning those in the northern edge of the U.S. could possibly see the aurora while it becomes “quite bright and active.”
<E>
<S>
The agency also has a strong geomagnetic storm watch in effect that could lead to a larger viewing area for the Northern Lights.
<E>
<S>
The viewing line stretches as low as central Nebraska, with the likelihood of aurora increasing the farther north people are from the line.
<E>
<S>
The viewing line is forecast to move further north by Sunday night, which is currently predicted to have a lesser KP index forecast of five, providing a lower likelihood of visibility than Saturday.
<E>
<S>
States within or partially included in the view line include Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Maine. Most regions within the states have a low likelihood of seeing the Northern Lights, though the upper edges of Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota have a much higher chance.

How Do You See The Northern Lights?
<E>
<S>
The hours between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. will mark the best potential viewing time for the Northern Lights. Those looking to catch a glimpse of the natural phenomenon should do so in areas with no light pollution and clear forecasts.
How Do You Photograph The Lights?
<E>
<S>
Night mode and longer exposure times on smartphones can help viewers grab photos of the Northern Lights, as well as an increase in camera exposure.
<E>
<S>
Saturday’s favorable forecast comes after a relatively strong showing on Friday night, which was forecast to produce a strong geomagnetic storm and featured a KP index of five. Increases in solar activity have been seen over the last few months ahead of the anticipated peak of Solar Cycle 25, the sun’s 11-year solar cycle which is expected to crest somewhere between late 2024 and early 2026. The cycle is forecast to produce intensifying sunspots (115 to be exact) and increasing geomagnetic storms.

Ben Horowitz and his wife will make a “significant” donation to Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a tweet from the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, a notable reversal of his support for former President Donald Trump announced last summer, when Trump seemed to be pulling key tech figures away from the Democratic Party.

<E>
<S>
The plan for Horowitz and his wife to donate to Harris was addressed in an email to employees of his venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, according to Axios, which first reported the development.
<E>
<S>
The email was later posted by Horowitz, who said he and his wife, Felicia, have known Harris for more than 10 years and has been “a great friend to both of us over that time.”
<E>
<S>
Horowitz message of support was not without its criticisms of Harris and President Joe Biden, as the investor said her campaign has yet to formally state its intentions with their tech policies and that the “Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry."
<E>
<S>
Horowitz said in his email his firm only supports politicians who are aligned with its “Little Tech Agenda,” a doctrine prioritizing the empowerment of tech startups and critiquing anti-tech policies and practices.
<E>
<S>
Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen, also pledged his support for Trump alongside Horowitz in July.

“As we stated earlier, the Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry, but especially as it relates to Crypto/Blockchain and AI,” Horowitz said in the email. “So, while I am very hopeful that the Harris Administration will be much better, they have not yet stated their intentions.”
Key Background
<E>
<S>
Horowitz, who said in his email Harris was a friend to his venture capital firm in its early days, planned to support Trump just three months ago, when The Information reported he and Andreessen told employees they were going to donate to PACs supporting Trump. The co-founders pledged their support for Trump before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and later posted a podcast explaining their rationale for backing Trump. Horowitz and Andreessen’s support for Trump was rooted in anticipation for the loosening of regulations in cryptocurrency. The venture capitalists joined a wide range of tech moguls who threw their support behind Trump this summer including Tesla chief Elon Musk, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Gemini executives Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

Prominent venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz both intend to donate to political action committees supporting former President Donald Trump, several outlets reported Tuesday, becoming the latest technology titans to back Trump’s reelection bid.

Andreesen and Horowitz, founder of the eponymous Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, told employees they intend to donate to PACs backing Trump, The Information first reported; the duo released a 90-minute podcast episode detailing their reasoning for endorsing Trump later Tuesday afternoon.
<E>
<S>
The duo’s motivation is largely due to an anticipated loosening of regulation in areas like cryptocurrency under Trump, anonymous sources told the Information and Axios.
<E>
<S>
Andreesen, worth $1.9 billion according to Forbes’ estimates, and Horowitz join a growing chorus out of the historically left-leaning Silicon Valley as major tech figures in Trump’s corner.
<E>
<S>
None are more notable than Elon Musk, the world’s richest man as the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, who said Saturday he “fully endorse[s]” Trump, and who The Wall Street Journal reported Monday said intends to spend about $45 million monthly on PACs dedicated to Trump (Musk responded to the report as “fake gnus”).
<E>
<S>
There are several other tech billionaires who recently donated to a nascent super PAC backing Trump, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, crypto kingpins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and venture capitalists Antonio Gracias and Douglas Leone, according to The Financial Times.
<E>
<S>
In addition to those listed above, some potentially surprising prominent billionaires who have endorsed Trump include investors Bill Ackman and Nelson Peltz, along with Gamestop CEO Ryan Cohen. Other billionaires who have donated more than $1 million to Trump election efforts include the world’s richest self-made woman, Diane Hendricks, banking heir Timothy Mellon and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson. One notable holdout is PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, a previous Trump donor who said as recently as last month he won’t give any money to Trump super PACs, but whose former employee, JD Vance, was just tapped as Trump’s running mate.
<E>
<S>
Andreessen and Horowitz are No. 36 and 37, respectively, on Forbes’ Midas List of the top venture capitalists, building their cache with early investments in the likes of Coinbase, Instagram and OpenAI. Andreessen is a member of Facebook parent Meta’s board of directors. Andreessen Horowitz is tightly linked to Musk’s empire, investing in the private aerospace giant SpaceX and financially backing Musk’s 2022 acquisition of X, then known as Twitter. Their idea of Trump, who called the biggest cryptocurrency bitcoin a “scam” in 2021 before vowing to be a “crypto president” on this campaign trail, as a boon for crypto is a view evidently shared by the market, with bitcoin prices up more than 10% over the last three days as election betting odds tilted in Trump’s favor.

<S>
“Stop persecuting our entrepreneurs,” major Democratic donor and eBay billionaire Jeff Skoll, who has reportedly donated $2 million to a PAC supporting Democratic Senate candidates, wrote Saturday on X. In his teardown of the Biden administration’s alleged mistreatment of Tesla, Skoll offered perhaps the clearest example of the reasoning behind Silicon Valley power players’ apparent rightward shift.

Cryptocurrency billionaires the Winklevoss twins on Thursday announced they are donating $1 million worth of bitcoin each to support Donald Trump, the latest billionaires to back the former president who has increasingly embraced cryptocurrencies on his 2024 campaign trail.

In an X post announcing his 15.47 BTC ($1 million) donation, Tyler Winklevoss said he will be voting for Trump in November because he was “pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business choice” and urged the “crypto army” to do the same.
<E>
<S>
In his lengthy post, the crypto billionaire attacked the Biden administration, saying it has “openly declared war against crypto” and accused it of weaponizing government agencies to “bully, harass, and sue the good actors in our industry.”
<E>
<S>
Cameron Winklevoss also said he has donated 15.47 BTC to Trump and said “he will put an end to the Biden Administration's war on crypto.”
<E>
<S>
Citing an unnamed spokesperson, CoinDesk reported the donations would go to the Trump 47 Committee, a joint fundraising committee that may divide the amount to comply with federal legal limits for campaign donations.

“The Biden Administration has consistently attacked American business across the board and villainized its greatest heroes. The crime is always success and the reward is always ridicule, fines, and even more red tape,” Tyler Winklevoss wrote in his post.

The Winklevoss twins and their cryptocurrency exchange Gemini have faced multiple investor and government lawsuits over the past few years stemming from the 2022 collapse of its high-interest earning program, Gemini Earn.

Trump and his campaign have been vocal about their pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin stance in recent months. This is a complete turnaround for the former president, who was previously skeptical of cryptocurrencies during his White House term. In 2019, he said he was “not a fan” of Bitcoin and other crypto tokens, which were “not money.” He then referred to these digital currencies as “highly volatile” assets “based on thin air,” and criticized them for facilitating “unlawful behavior.” In the past few months, however, Trump has made an effort to garner support from the tech and crypto industry and has presented himself as their supporter. The former president’s campaign now accepts cryptocurrency donations and even claimed bitcoin miners help “stabilize energy supply from the grid.” In a post on his Truth Social platform earlier this month, the former President said he wants all remaining bitcoin to be mined in the U.S. and positioned the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency as the “last line of defense against” a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Trump also attacked Biden’s “hatred of Bitcoin”, saying his stance only helps “China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left.”

Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign hopes to get a boost as former President Barack Obama sets out to stump for her in swing states, adding a Democratic heavyweight to campaign events with a history of success in grassroots outreach and digital focus.

Obama is headed first to Pittsburgh on Oct. 10, according to Hannah Hankins, a communication director at the Office of President Barack Obama—full details on the Pennsylvania trip and the rest of Obama’s trips have not yet been revealed, but he will continue to hold rallies in battleground states through Election Day, Hankins said.
<E>
<S>
By joining Harris on the trail, Obama may be resurrecting the “yes, we can” ethos of 2008, when the campaign enlisted supporters “to do the difficult and often socially risky work of having real conversations with friends and neighbors about the election,” Liz McKenna, an assistant professor at Harvard University and political sociologist, told Forbes.
<E>
<S>
A critical and often overlooked strategy from the Obama campaign was to organize local teams of supporters, rather than paid canvassers or out-of-state volunteers, to do the majority of in-person “get out the vote” McKenna said.
<E>
<S>
Sophisticated targeting and digital tactics, now standard practice, were another pioneering strategy in the 2008 Obama campaign, Steve Caplan, an advertising expert and adjunct instructor at the University of Southern California, told Forbes.
<E>
<S>
The coming Obama rallies may also become a source of content for future Harris advertising that can be amplified by digital media, a tactic used during the Obama campaigns, Caplan said.
How Is Harris’ Campaign Similar To Obama’s?
<E>
<S>
Harris’ campaign has hired key Obama pollsters, speechwriters, aides, strategists and advisers like David Plouffe, Obama’s 2008 campaign manager; Stephanie Cutter, a former deputy campaign manager and strategist; and Mitch Stewart, an organizing operative, among others. The two politicians differ, but the buzz around Harris’ campaign compares to Obama’s 2008 campaign by promoting a positive outlook, Jamal Simmons, a former Harris adviser, told Reuters. Simmons is pointing to Harris’ campaign promotion of “a new way forward” with joy and positivity, while Obama’s campaign became associated with hope and change, a winning message considering the sweeping victory it brought. “This is already a sharp contrast to the Clinton 2016 and Biden 2020 campaigns, which did not have the same authentic groundswell of enthusiasm,” McKenna said. Other similarities exist in the campaigns through the mass training events called “Camp Kamala,” reminiscent of “Camp Obama” programs from 2007. But the Harris campaign has operated for far less time, so “Camp Kamala” is focused on last-minute mobilization tactics such as phone calls and door knocking, while the “Camp Obama” events were dayslong sessions held a year before the election to teach about grassroots organizing and leadership, McKenna said. The Harris campaign’s efforts on TikTok and with online jokes reaching younger audiences (even if the memes have often been user-generated and Trump has a substantially larger social media command) garnered significant attention after she launched her campaign in July.
<E>
<S>
After endorsing Harris in July and calling her the successor of his movement and coalition (“Now the torch has been passed,” he said in his Democratic National Convention speech), Obama’s support in fundraising events and content has raised more than $76 million for Harris’ campaign. Obama, in some ways a mentor to Harris, will expand his involvement in campaign efforts in the coming days, according to adviser Eric Schultz, who said the former president plans to “do everything he can” to help Harris win. Even before joining the trail, Obama played a role in Harris’ campaign by offering campaigning advice (occasionally unsolicited), according to reporting by Reuters.
<E>
<S>
Harris and Obama met two decades ago, and Harris went on to support Obama’s 2008 campaign by knocking on doors and helping fundraise before the Iowa caucuses, the BBC reported. Obama later supported Harris during her campaign to be California’s attorney general in 2010 and her Senate bid in 2016.
